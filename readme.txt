It is best to create a new page called “Orders” “Order Online” or something similar and then add the plugin to that page.
Ask your web-designer for the best place to showcase your menu or inventory.

You can add your menu in a new post/page or an existing one using this shortcode.

`[moo_all_items]`

With the 2nd style you can use this shortcode to display item for one category

`[moo_all_items category='cat_id']` : replace the vat_id with the category's id
